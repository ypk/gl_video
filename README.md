# GL Video

This is a video manipulation example using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. It manipulates the pixels of a video to display the video on canvas as a grayscale image.

Note: Due to the nature of this example (autoplaying video) this project will not run properly on most modern browsers as browsers have inbuilt functionality to prevent autoplaying of videos without user interaction
